# My Very First Web Page

Welcome!

This is my first web page project while  learning with Code Institute.
I have learned to use many tools while creating this project such as, HTML, CSS, cloud9, git and github.
I used pictures from google and shared information from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page.

The following link is to a working example of my project https://nathanchilds89.github.io/my-first-website/
